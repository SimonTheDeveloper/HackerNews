How to run app:
Running from Visual studio this application can be called from https://localhost:44307/api/story.


Assumptions:
The beststories.json file contains more than 20 stories. I assumed that the ids in the files are ordered with the best story being the first id. So I took the first 20 stories. I then ordered these 20 stories by name.


What to do if there were more time:

- Make API asynchronous
- Help page for Api
- Better caching mechanism
- Producer-Consumer pattern to deal with multiple requests
- Unit Tests
